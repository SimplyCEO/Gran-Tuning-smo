Gran Tuning'smo Project
=======================

Gran Tuning'smo is a wiki project that provides information about
events, licences, vehicles and utilities for Gran Turismo.

The project started as a quick wiki for Gran Turismo 2 with
savegames containing tuned vehicles both for fun driving and event related.

Pages
-----

Check out the topics about this wiki:

- [Dealership Locations](/dealership/LIST.md):<br>
Contains information about vehicles that can be used for such events,
as well as save files with already tuned vehicles.

Contributors
------------

This is a very WIP project, so there's nothing much here that will drastically change
the play.<br>
Soon there will be a contribution section, with included save files containing sufficient funds
to develop vehicles and their tunings.

Templates
---------

Templates are required to maintain a consistent wiki. It also provides
a better understanding of the table information and manuscripts.

Template page is being built slowly, but can be accessed by [clicking here](/.template/INSTRUCTIONS.md).
